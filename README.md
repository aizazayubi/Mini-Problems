# Mini-Problems

A collection of small algorithmic and programming challenges solved in Python. This repository is a practice ground to improve logic, problem‑solving, and coding skills.

## Included Problems

* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Check Balanced Parentheses (using Stack)
* Stack Class Implementation

## Repository Structure

```
Mini-Problems/
├── Algorithms/        # Solved problems

```

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run any solution:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizazayubi/Mini-Problems.git
cd Mini-Problems/Algorithms
python filename.py
```

Each file in the **Algorithms** directory contains:

* A short problem statement
* A clean Python solution

## Purpose

* Strengthen algorithmic thinking
* Prepare for coding interviews
* Build a quick reference for common patterns
* Keep mini‑solutions organized in one place

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can:

* Add new problems
* Improve or optimize existing solutions
* Enhance readability with brief comments

Please keep the code clean and simple.
